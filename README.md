# 🚗 Metrocar User Funnel Analysis

### 📊 Data Analytics Portfolio Project by Iryna Litvinova

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
Identify the main drop-off stages in Metrocar’s user funnel — from app installation to the first completed ride — and provide data-driven recommendations to improve conversion and user experience.

---

## 📘 Project Context

**Metrocar** is a ride-hailing platform (similar to Uber/Bolt).  
The dataset includes user activity from the moment of app installation to ride completion or cancellation, covering:
- 23,606 app downloads  
- 385,477 total ride records  
- Platforms: iOS, Android, Web  
- Variables: time of day, day of week, user age, rating, status, ride type  

---

## 🧠 Objectives
1. Build a **user conversion funnel** and identify drop-off points.  
2. Analyze **platform and demographic patterns**.  
3. Investigate **ride cancellations** and waiting times.  
4. Estimate **potential revenue loss** and improvement opportunities.  
5. Deliver **business recommendations** to increase user engagement.

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation
- Cleaned duplicates and missing values.  
- Normalized trip distances and times.  
- Merged user, ride, and feedback datasets.  
- Converted timestamps into time-of-day categories (morning, day, evening, night).

## 📈 Key Findings

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| App Downloads | 23,606 |
| Users who completed at least one ride | 6,233 (26.4%) |
| Actual revenue | $4.25M |
| Potential revenue | $15.1M |
| Estimated loss | ~$10.8M |

### 💡 Major drop-off points
- **Registration not completed** – 27% of users quit before finishing sign-up → *~$6.4M lost*  
- **No first ride after registration** – weak onboarding → *~$5.6M lost*  
- **Cancellations** – 42% of all rides canceled due to long waiting time (~15 min) → *~$3.2M lost*  

---

## 🧩 Business Insights

1. **Simplify registration:** reduce mandatory fields, allow login with Google/Apple.  
2. **First-ride activation:** offer discounts or bonuses for the first trip.  
3. **Optimize driver allocation:** reduce average waiting time from 15 → 5 minutes.  
4. **Feedback system:** encourage short feedback via emojis or one-click rating.  
5. **Driver quality control:** retraining and monitoring low-rated drivers.

---

## 🧮 Tools Used
- **Excel / Google Sheets** – initial cleaning & descriptive statistics  
- **SQL** – user funnel analysis  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** – data transformation & visualization  
- **Google Data Studio** – dashboard creation  

---

## 📊 Suggested Future Analysis
- Weather impact on ride demand and cancellations (API integration).  
- Effect of car type (economy, premium, VIP) on user choice.  
- Gender safety analysis for female users (option to select driver gender).  
- Predictive model for ride cancellation risk.

---

## 🚀 Results & Impact
- Identified $10.8M in potential revenue loss.  
- Proposed operational and UX changes to recover ~35–40% of that loss.  
- Created actionable framework for monitoring user retention.
